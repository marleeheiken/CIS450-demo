# CIS450-demo

## Introduction
This repo illustrates the best practice READ.ME file generation.

## Projects
1. Open CV Image Processing demo
2. Making a panorama using Open CD
3. Edge Finding using Open CV

### How Edge Detection works 
-  Edge detection is used to identify sharp changes in brightness that typically signify object edges, lines, or even textures like in the Mona Lisa painting example we used. Edges are detected mathematically using gradients, which measure changes in pixel intencity.
